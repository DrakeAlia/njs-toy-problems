// Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10 or 10,000

// Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as 
// possible. Consider using loops that would allow you to type the 
// fewest characters/commands. While you could simply print the even 
// numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way 
// that would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra 
// effort.
